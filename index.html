                    In today's social media age, we see trends happen every day. Every so often, 
                    a celebrity would trend on social media platforms over behavior considered offensive or socially unacceptable. 
                    From politics to Hollywood, all kinds of public figures have been called out and criticized by the masses. 
                    This form of ​​modern ostracism is known as “cancel culture”, where the public attempt to call out and boycott an individual in response to something problematic they've said or done. 
                    In particular, the music industry is no stranger to cancel culture as countless musicians such as

                    The rise of cancel culture has given power to people on social media platforms like Twitter,

                    This common occurence of musicians getting canceled on Twitter made us wonder: among English-speaking Twitter users, how does their sentiment towards canceled musicians change over time?
                    To answer this question, we analyzed how public sentiment was affected by the type of issue the musician was canceled for, the background of the musician, 
                    and the strength of the musician's parasocial relationship with their fans.

                    To measure sentiment for each artist, we utilized sentiment analysis, which is a 
                    natural language processing technique that quantifies emotions detected in a piece of text. 
                    Because we're interested in seeing if there is a change in negative sentiment over time,
                    we calculated two scores, severe toxicity and insult probability scores, on all our tweet data.  
                    Tweets that are higher in toxicity or negative sentiment are given higher severe toxicity and insult scores.

                <p class="article-text">
                    The case studies we present overlap in the type of issue they are “canceled” for. For example, both Lucas 
                    and Zayn Malik faced backlash for abuse related conflicts. Lucas was canceled for emotional abuse 
                    allegations and Zayn was accused of physical assault. Another category is discrimation towards a marginalized group. 
                    Three of our case studies that fall into this category: Giselle, Doja Cat, and Dababy. 
                    Giselle and Doja Cat both received harsh criticism for singing terms which are commonly used to degrade the African American community. 
                    Similarly, Dababy made homophobic remarks which disrespected the LGBTQ+ community. The final category is misinformation 
                    which includes Nicki Minaj’s controversy for COVID vaccine misinformation. Given the current socio-political environment, 
                    we believe that the issue an individual was canceled for could influence the severity of the sentiment.
                </p>

                <p class="article-text">
                    To test this, we conducted two types of analysis: qualitative and quantitative. 
                    For the qualitative analysis, we compared the words with the highest frequency 
                    before and after the controversy. Based on this, we will be able to determine 
                    which category promoted more dialogue surrounding the conflict. In regards to the 
                    quantitative analysis, for each category, we compared the severe toxicity and insult 
                    levels before and after the date of the controversy.

                <p class="article-text">
                    Outside of just being in the music industry, the individuals we chose
                    have a lot of similarities in their background, but also have distinct differences between them. 
                    We believe these differences may influence the severity of negative sentiment, as well as the duration of that negative sentiment after getting canceled. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="article-text">
                    In order to determine whether or not the background of an artist has an effect 
                    on the sentiment they receive after being canceled, we created two different groups 
                    to look at. Our first group of artists is based on the genre of music they make. 
                    The genre categories that our artists fall into are K-pop, Hip-Hop, and Western Pop. 
                    The second group of artists is based on their sex, so comparing female artists and male artists. 
                    The metric we used to compare artists in these groupings is determined by the number of days after 
                    cancellation it takes for the median sentiment level to return to its pre-controversy median level.
                </p>
                <h3 class="topic-headers article-text">Strength of Parasocial Relationships</h3>
                <p class="article-text">
                    Parasocial relationships are one-sided relationships where an individual develops an illusion of an 
                    intimate relationship with a media personality, as a result of repeated interactions between both individuals. 
                    For example, a fan who has followed an artist for a period of time and has learnt enough about them
                    to develop a sense of loyalty might feel that they have a personal connection with the artist. 
                    Depending on the strength of the relationship, media personalities can have strong influence 
                    over their audiences as evident with fandoms like BTS’s ARMYs or Taylor Swift’s Swifties.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="article-text">
                    To determine which artists have either a strong or weak parasocial relationship with their fanbase, we used the following two metrics: the artist's mean tweet engagement and the amount of tweets mentioning their fandom. 
                    Based on those metrics, we then grouped our artists into two groups: artists with strong or weak parasocial fan bases.

                    has a slightly large spike in severe toxicity and two more spikes are seen around the

                    Comparing different genres to each other, hip-hop stands out. For both severe toxicity 
                    and insult level tables, <b>hip-hop artists’ sentiment levels took the longest to return back 
                    to normal or pre-controversy levels</b> compared to K-pop and pop artists. The results for grouping 
                    by sex show that <b>canceled male artists experience a much longer effect from cancelling</b>. 
                    In terms of duration, canceled male artists experience a rise in severe toxicity for more 
                    than three times longer than female artists. For median insult levels, the rise in insults is more than

                For each canceled artist, we used
                <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en">Twitter's Developer API</a>
                to gather tweets related to them and their controveries 6 months 
                before and after they have gotten canceled. As each canceled artist 
                has a control artist, the data for the control artists consists
                of tweets within the same time frame as their corresponding canceled artist.
                For example, datasets for Nicki Minaj and Saweetie only contains tweets that were tweeted
                6 months before and after Nicki Minaj's cancellation date.

            <h5 class="article-text">Sentiment Analysis</h5>
            <p class="article-text">
                We utilized 
                <a href="https://www.perspectiveapi.com/">Google's Perspective API</a>
                to measure sentiment on our tweet datasets.
                The API calculates the probability that a tweet would be perceived as either
                severely toxic or an insult and thus would give a score from 0 to 1. 
                The higher the score, the more likely the tweet would be perceived as the
                given attribute. The Perspective API can calculate toxic and severe toxicity
                probability scores, but we chose severe toxicity as it is less sensitive to milder forms of toxicity, 
                such as text that contains profanity used in a positive way.

            <p class="article-text">
                As part of the preprocessing process, we calculated the severe toxicity and insult probability 
                scores for every tweet across all our datasets. We also applied a rolling median of 
                14 days on our data in order to better visualize long term trends.

                To evaluate the influence of the type of conflict an individual faced 
                criticism for, we utilized two techniques. The first was qualitative analysis. 
                After grouping the case studies into their respective categories 
                (discrimation, assault, or misinformation), we generated two lists of 
                the words with the highest frequency. The first included only the words 
                referring to individuals prior to the conflict whereas the second only 
                included words from the tweets after the controversy date. For each category, 
                we plotted a before and after bar graph to compare 10 most common words. The 
                second technique was quantitative analysis. Here, we compared the severe toxicity 
                and insult levels before and after the controversy.

                To investigate the impact of an artist’s background on sentiment, we grouped the artists by genre and 
                sex. We then calculated the median severe toxicity and insult levels for each group across our specified time period. 
                In order to quantify the effect of our visualizations, we calculated how many days 
                after controversy it took until the median severe toxicity and insult levels returned to 
                pre-controversy levels. We calculated this metric by taking the sentiment indicator level at day 0, or
                the day of the controversy, and finding the first instance of the indicator level being below the day 0 level 
                after cancellation. We calculated this for each group to determine if 
                there was a difference between groups for that background category.

                To categorize the strength of each artist's parasocial relationship with their fanbases,
                we calculated the total mean engagement, which is the sum of each artist's mean number
                of retweets, likes, replies, and quote tweets, of all tweets on an artist's official Twitter account 
                tweeted within the 6 month before and after cancellation time frame. We also calculated
                the fandom strength of each artist by summing the number of tweets that mentioned the artist's
                fandom name from our initial artist tweet dataset then dividing that number by the total number of tweets
                in that dataset. Artists who reached above both metric thresholds were categorized as having a strong parasocial fanbase, 
                while the others were categorized as weak.
